Football Quiz App built for Android-Platform during Programming A course in Swedish High-School.

During the introduction course in Programming A in Swedish High School we had a final project to create something from scratch and I decided to create a Football Quiz Game for this task. This app was uploaded to Android Play Store and had about 200,000 downloads and had a world leaderboard so you could compete with players from all over the world. This app was released in 2011 and might have been inspiration for some of the Logo Quiz-games that grew to be so big during 2012, who knows? I had a lot of fun at least and was proud of what I accomplished during the course Programming A(which also was my grade in the subject).

This code was, as stated above, written in 2011 but still highlights my ability to learn quickly and produce actual code even though it was only an introduction course that lasted one semester.
